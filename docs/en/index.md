# What is VonSim?

VonSim is a tool designed for teaching and learning computer architecture and organization. It consists of an environment for developing programs in [assembly language](./computer/assembly) and a simulator for them.

It is [based](./computer/cpu) on the Intel 8088 processor and features:

- four 16-bit general-purpose registers;
- a [main memory](./computer/memory) of 32 kB;
- a 16-bit address bus and an 8-bit data bus;
- software interrupts (such as keyboard input and screen output);
- hardware interrupts with a [PIC](./io/modules/pic) (Programmable Interrupt Controller);
- multiple [devices](./io/devices/index): clock, switches, LEDs, and a Centronics printer.

These devices are inspired by their counterparts specified in Intel's iAPX 88 (or 8088 family). These are a set of devices designed by Intel to work seamlessly with the 8088 processor. More details can be found in the [iAPX 88 User's Manual (1981)](http://www.bitsavers.org/components/intel/8086/1981_iAPX_86_88_Users_Manual.pdf).

::: warning Simplifications
This simulator is not intended to be a faithful emulator of the 8088. On the contrary, it aims to be a tool for teaching computer architecture. Therefore, multiple simplifications have been made compared to the 8088 that would make it difficult to use in a real environment. Likewise, the instruction set is much smaller than that of the 8088, and its encoding is simpler.
